    <h1> Detail about me!!</h1>
    <p>I am a motivated and disciplined software development student with a strong focus on building practical, future-ready skills in web development and programming. After completing my Class 12 education, I made a deliberate decision to pursue hands-on technical learning, recognizing the importance of foundational problem-solving and logical thinking in modern software engineering. <br>
         I am actively strengthening my understanding of core concepts, including programming fundamentals and applied mathematics, to support long-term growth as a developer.

I approach learning with a structured and goal-oriented mindset, emphasizing consistency, execution, and continuous improvement. Rather than passive study, I prioritize practical implementation, self-directed projects, and skill compounding. I am comfortable working independently, adapting quickly to new tools and technologies, and breaking down complex problems into manageable. <br>

My long-term objective is to become a highly capable software professional who delivers reliable, efficient, and scalable solutions. I value discipline, clarity, and accountability in my work and actively seek environments that challenge me to grow technically and professionally. I am eager to contribute to teams where learning, execution, and impact are valued.</p>
